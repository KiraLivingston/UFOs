# UFOs

The purpose of this challenge is to create filters in a table using javacript to filter data on UFO sightings.  There should be a way to filter data using multiple fields by using filters for city, state, country, and shape.  The table originally filtered by date only, so the challenge was to create the additional 4 filters to make them dynamic to be able to provide a more in depth search by the user.

## Objectives

*Use Javascript to modify the index.html file to create additional table filters
* Add additional filters for the city, state, country, and shape
* Create a new function that will loop through dataset to keep only the results of the filtered data

## Resources

*Javascript
*HTML
*css

## Analysis

I created the filters by adding the addional 4 fields to the table by referencing the data.js file.  Then code was written to save data when a filter value was changed in the search box.  Then a function was written to update the table.  The user just enters a specific filter and clicks the button and hence the data is filtered according the search parameter.  I believe a better was to design the table would be to add dropdowns to make it easier to choose your filter parameter.  Also it would be beneficial to extend the data set in the challenge to make it much more useable to obtain information about UFO's.  This could possibly be completed by setting up a web scraping to constantly update the dataset.
